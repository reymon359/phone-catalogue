# Phone Catalogue

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Then it was added an Express server in the `server` directory. The server is proxied via the `proxy` key in `package.json`.

Project done for the [Guidesmiths](https://www.guidesmiths.com/) interview code challenge about React ( [more info here](https://github.com/guidesmiths/interview-code-challenges/blob/master/react/phone-catalogue) )
